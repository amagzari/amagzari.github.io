I am currently a data scientist at mHealth Research Group in the faculty of Medicine at UBC where I build NLP healthcare solutions under the supervision of [Dr. Richard Lester](https://datascienceandhealth.ubc.ca/people/rich-lester). A sample project would be the classification of patient-clinician conversations to extract insight regarding the impact of home isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda. 

I recently obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UBC. Through coursework and projects, I developed a deep understanding of Machine Learning algorithms and practices. In one of my projects, I implemented a U-Net network, enhanced with a convolution block attention module to preform multiclass semantic segmentation of urban scenery, which prompted my interest in computer vision tasks, such as scene understanding. 

I now aspire to venture into further research in vision and language.
